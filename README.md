- .NET 8 SDK
- SQL Server Express LocalDB (installed with Visual Studio)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

      git clone https://github.com/jacksoncooper12/ESC-Assessment.git

2. Open the .sln file in Visual Studio 2022

3. Run the project within Visual Studio 2022. The SQL Server is self-contained within the Database folder, so no additional setup is required.
